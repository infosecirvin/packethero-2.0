Part 1: GCP

  Step 1:
    Creating a Project
      Click -> project drop down menu (3rd button in header)
      Click -> NEW PROJECT
      Open the project.
      Click -> Navigation Menu (1st button in header)
      Click -> Compute Engine *
      * Compute Engine set up automatically starts after clicking on it
      Wait for Compute Engine to finish setting up
      (To see set up statuses click on 3rd to last button in header)

  Step 2:
    Creating a New VM Instance
    Make sure you're still in the project's compute engine
    Click -> Create Instance
    Instance Values to Change:
      Name: packethero
      Firewall: Check -> "Allow HTTP traffic" and "Allow HTTPS traffic"
      Boot Disk: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)

  Step 3:
    Creating your MySQL Database
    Use the search bar in the header and type: Cloud SQL Admin API
    Click -> Cloud SQL Admin API
    Click -> Enable

    Search -> Cloud SQL
    Click -> Cloud SQL (THE ONE WITH THE SHOPPING CART NOT THE ONE WITH THE API LOGO)
    Click -> GO TO CLOUD SQL
    Click -> CREATE INSTANCE
    Click -> Choose MySQL
    Instance Values to Change:
      Instance ID: packethero-db
      Root password: Click on Generate (copy and save the password somewhere you can access later)
    Click -> Create
    Wait...
    (until green check mark appears next to Instance ID)

    Click -> packethero-db
    Ctrl + f -> Connect using Cloud Shell
    Open up the terminal (5th to last button in header)
    Wait...
    (until terminal loads, try refreshing page if it takes a while)

Part 2:
  Step 4:
    Creating Database Tables
    After your terminal has loaded
    Type: gcloud sql connect packethero-db --user=root --quiet
    Make sure your database name matches
    Hit Enter
    Wait...
    Enter Password
    Copy and Paste the following:
        CREATE DATABASE packethero;
        USE packethero;
        CREATE TABLE gamers (
          id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          username VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
          teamname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
          room VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
          admin INT NOT NULL,
          session VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
          song VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
        );
        QUIT;

    Close Terminal

Part 3:
  Step 5:
    Uploading Code
    Click -> Navigation Menu (1st button in header)
    Click -> Compute Engine
    Click -> SSH
    (Under the connect column of the table that loaded)
    Wait for the terminal to load
    Copy Paste the following:
      sudo apt-get -y update
      sudo apt-get -y upgrade
      sudo apt-get -y install python3 python3-pip python3-dev nginx git-all
      git clone https://github.com/yonJM1267/packethero-2.0.git
      pip3 install flask flask_socketio flask_login flask_wtf wtforms eventlet sqlalchemy flask_sqlalchemy pymysql uwsgi

Part 4:
  Step 6:
    Configuring Database
    You will continue working in the terminal you opened in Part 3
    Enter -> nano packethero-2.0/apps.py
    You'll be editing this file later
    
    Leave this window open and go back to GCP
    Click -> Navigation Menu (1st button in header)
    Click -> SQL
    Click -> packethero-db
    Click -> Users
    Click -> Create user account
    Variables to Change:
      Username: Make one
      Password: Make one
      Host name: select -> Allow any host (%)
    Click -> CREATE
    Click -> Connections -> + Add Network
    Add the IP of the VM you created in Step 2 and click save
   
   Step 7:
    Configuring Code
    Go back to the terminal and edit the following variables
    username, passw
    Replace their placeholders with the credentials you just created in GCP
    Replace the SECRET_KEY placeholder with a random alphanumerical string
    (ex: SECRET_KEY='A942AF74DD7FFA84FB96973515BEE')
    Ctrl + S -> This command saves the changes

    Go back to GCP (still in SQL page)
    Click -> Overview
    Copy -> Public IP address 
    Replace the Host variable's placeholder with this Connection Name and save the file
